	* not really an update but just documenting it here
	* maybe more features in 3.0.4a
* removed testing mode

>v3.0.3a
* added a walkspeed bypass after so long but the reason it took so long was because i wrote it in the wrong place (the start of the script)
* polished script up (still bad)
* thats all
