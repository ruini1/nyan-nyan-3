>press end to toggle the ui btw

#### i WILL come back to this soon, dont worry ^^

# DEVLOG
### wouldnt call this a content update so i left it here aka v3.0.3aa

* temporarily capped reach slider to 15 (will be changed back soon dont worry)
* renamed script again because i like cake more
* finally renamed the directories so you can access your themes and configs better
	* not really an update but just documenting it here
	* maybe more features in 3.0.4a
* removed testing mode
* added pocket cake (nonblatant), i decided not to add blatant mode as it was useless.
	> yes, i did add its own directories. dont worry.
* few minutes later i nerfed the maximum size to 5
* thats all


>v3.0.3a
* added a walkspeed bypass after so long but the reason it took so long was because i wrote it in the wrong place (the start of the script)
* polished script up (still bad)
* thats all

# future stuff
* more features so the ui doesnt look entirely empty
>inb4 more movement
* more customization
