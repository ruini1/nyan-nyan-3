# DEVLOG
* added a walkspeed bypass after so long but the reason it took so wrong was because i wrote it in the wrong place (the start of the script)
* polished script up (still bad)
* thats all

#future stuff

* blatant, truely blatant and nonblatant mode:
	* BLATANT MODE: changes the reach sliders cap to 40
	* NONBLATANT: caps the reach slider to 10 
	* TRUELY BLATANT: caps the reach slider to 300 and unlocks some features in the script such as the movement tab (more coming soon)
